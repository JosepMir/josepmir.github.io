				<h2>Josep Mir Izard</h2>
                <p>
                    As a freelance software developer, I've helped many companies make their ideas come true. <br/><br/>Having started coding with QBasic when I was a child, I have never stopped since then. Transitioning from MS-DOS to Windows to the Web with some other incursions along the way: Mobile Phones (Nokia, Android, both in Java), embedded arduino firmware, 3D modelling using Unity, and even algoTrading. As you may probably know, the tech world is not short of keywords, buzzwords, and acronyms. Not gonna list them all... I have learned to talk to customers in a plain way. 
					After the GFC I moved to Germany, were I spent 5 years working for german Customers. Currently residing in Barcelona again.
					<br/><br/>
					Other interests I have are music, drone flying, and DIY in general.

                    <p>
                        Abstract: This project is about the construction feasibility of a system for the follow-up of a marmot’s population weight in high mountain. We build a weighing scale with a force sensor and a
                        temperature sensor. These analog outputs connect to an ATmega8 microcontroller that, with an algorithm developed in this project, is in continuous listening to detect sudden changes in
                        the weight. When this happens, the data is recorded in a SRAM memory for, later, being able to download this data to a computer for it to be analyzed by a program that has been created
                        for such purpose.
